# Full Stack React Task List (CRUD)
![Project screenshot](project-image/fullstack-task-list-aws-deployed.png)

## Purpose

This application was created specifically to practice deploying a real-world application to AWS. The app has a persistent database that any user can interact with. This means that the task list is not instanced to each particular user. If you want to see a ToDo List I created that is instanced to each user and is stored in local storage, visit https://softdeveloper23.github.io/to-do-list-app/ to test that app live.

## Technologies Used

DynamoDB | Lambda | Amplify | Express | React | Node

## Application

A task list that can add/delete/update/ and cross out tasks. The project was built using React as the frontend UI and Node.js/Express.js for the backend. 

## Deployment

The project was deployed to Amazon Web Services using DynamoDB and Lambda to house the database and Amplify to build and deploy the UI.
